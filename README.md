##Basic information
* I chose Java as programming language
* project uses Lombok library, so please make sure your IDE has annotation processing enabled
* since project does not need to be a "runnable application", the entry point is in RequestHandler class and
  requests are very generic with all possible fields
* there should not be any framework, so application context is built manually
* for simplicity, I've put integration tests in "com.integration" package
